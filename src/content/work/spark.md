##### Introduction
This document presents a school project carried out as part of the Python module. The aim was to apply the knowledge acquired in machine learning to predict the presence of pneumonia from chest X-ray images.
<br><br>

##### Targets
The aims of this project are to:
- Learn to train supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms.
- Compare the performance of different algorithms for classifying medical images.
- Use a set of photos to determine whether or not a lung has pneumonia.
<br><br>

##### Algorithms used
Supervised :
- Random Forest
- Linear regression
- Decision Tree
<br><br>

Unsupervised :
- K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
- K-Means
<br><br>

##### Data
The dataset used for this project is Chest X-ray Images (Pneumonia). It contains more than 5,800 chest X-ray images, around 30% of which are cases of pneumonia.
<br><br>

##### Methodology
Data pre-processing:
- Image resizing.
- Normalisation of pixel values.
- Separation of data into training, validation and test sets.
<br><br>

Model training:
- Implementation of different machine learning algorithms.
- Optimisation of hyperparameters for each model.
<br><br>

Model evaluation:
- Calculation of performance metrics (precision, recall, F1-score).
- Comparison of the performance of different models.
<br><br>

##### Conclusion
This project has enabled us to put into practice the knowledge we have acquired in machine learning and medical image processing. The results are promising and could be used to develop tools to help diagnose pneumonia.
<br><br>
