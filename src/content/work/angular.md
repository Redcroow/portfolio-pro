##### Introduction
This document presents a school project carried out as part of the Angular module. The aim was to create a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using Angular on the front end and Java Spring Boot on the back end.
<br><br>

##### Technologies used
Front-end :
- Angular
- TypeScript
- HTML
- CSS 
<br><br>

Back-end :
- Java Spring Boot
- JPA
- MySQL
<br><br>

##### Project architecture
The application consists of two main parts:
Angular :
- User interface for creating, reading, modifying and deleting data.
- Communication with the back-end via the REST API.
<br><br>

Java Spring Boot back-end:
- REST API for data management.
- Data stored in a MySQL database.
<br><br>

##### Features
The CRUD application allows you to :
- Create new objects.
- Read the list of objects.
- Modify object information.
- Delete an object.
<br><br>

##### Conclusion
This project was an opportunity to put into practice the knowledge acquired in the Angular module. Using Spring Boot on the back-end enabled us to create a robust and easy-to-use REST API.
<br><br>
